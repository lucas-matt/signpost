# MongoDB Realm Functions

These are backend functions for the signpost-app.

There are three functions with fairly basic behavior:

* getLocalMessages - get a set of messages with a certain radius of a given latitude/longitude
* search - Searches for messages matching the given term
* insertMessage - Writes message to messages collection
